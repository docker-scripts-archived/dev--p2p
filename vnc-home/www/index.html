    <h1><a href="https://github.com/dashohoxha/p2p">P2P Server</a></h1>

    <h2>Installation on the client</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Get the scripts from GitHub:
	<pre>git clone https://github.com/dashohoxha/p2p.git p2p-vnc</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Set the P2P server that you want to use:
	<pre>p2p-vnc/client/use.sh p2p.btranslator.org</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage on client</h2>

    <h3>1. Sharing the desktop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To share the desktop we need a VNC server. Make sure
	that <strong>x11vnc</strong> is installed:
	<pre>sudo apt-get install x11vnc</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Now share the VNC port and start the <strong>x11vnc</strong>
      server:
	<pre>p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh 

KEY: b8e1f1e779

Give it to the remote part in order to access your desktop.
To stop the connection run: p2p-vnc/client/stop.sh b8e1f1e779
</pre>
	The script will return a randomly generated key which you
	should give to the other part which needs to access your
	desktop.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Accessing a shared desktop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To access a shared desktop we need a VNC client. Make sure
	that <strong>vncviewer</strong> is installed:
	<pre>sudo apt-get install vncviewer</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Now connect to the remote VNC port and start
      the <strong>vncviewer</strong>.
	<pre>p2p-vnc/client/start_vncviewer.sh --key=b8e1f1e779</pre>
	You will need to know the number of the key that was created
	by the remote desktop.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Closing a connection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>From any (or both) of the clients, the connection can be
	closed with:
	<pre>p2p-vnc/client/stop.sh b8e1f1e779</pre>
	This will cleanup the keys on the server, close the ssh
	tunnels, and close the programs that were started locally
	(x11vnc, vncviewer, etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other Use Cases</h2>

    <h3> + Sharing a single widow</h3>

    <p>Use the option <code>--window=yes</code> from command line (or set it on
    <code>vnc.rc</code>) to share only a single window (not the whole
    desktop). When this option is <strong>yes</strong>, the mouse will
    become like a <strong>+</strong> (cross-hair) and you will be able
    to select a window.</p>

    <h3> + Make a demonstration to one or more people</h3>

    <p>Start <strong>x11vnc</strong> with options like these:
      <pre>p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh --viewonly=yes --shared=yes</pre>
      The remote viewers will not be able to control your desktop (or
      window) and more than one viewers will be able to connect.</p>

    <h3> + Share the desktop permanently</h3>

    <p>Suppose that time after time you need to access the computer at
      home remotely. Usually, after <strong>vncviewer</strong> is
      closed, <strong>x11vnc</strong> is closed automatically. But if
      the option <code>--forever=yes</code> is used, x11vnc will keep
      listening for more connections (after the first client(s)
      disconnect).
      <pre>p2p-vnc/client/start_x11vnc.sh --forever=yes</pre>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that a cron job on the P2P
      server will automatically delete keys older than one
      day. Without the key, you will not be able to access the desktop
      even if <em>x11vnc</em> is still listening. If this is not what
      you want, try to fix this on the P2P server (either stop the
      cron or make the period longer).</p>

    <h3> + Share the Linux console (tty)</h3>

    <p>This is very similar to sharing the desktop, but it can share the
      Linux consoles (from tty2 to tty6):
      <pre>p2p-vnc/client/start_linuxvnc.sh --tty=3</pre>
    </p>

    <h3> + Share your local webserver</h3>

    <p>Usually web developers use a local webserver for building an
      application.  What would you do to show the current prototype to
      the customer or to another developer? You can share your
      desktop, or you can share only the window of the browser. But
      you can also share your local webserver (port 80 and 443).</p>

    <p>It can be done like this:
      <ul>
	<li>On you side you run:
	  <pre>sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_share.sh 80
3e41a200bd
sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_share.sh 443
c9277c986d</pre>
	  You need <code>sudo</code> in this case
	  because <strong>80</strong> and <strong>443</strong> are
	  privileged ports and can be forwarded only by root.
	</li>
	<li>On the other side, your partner should run:
	  <pre>sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_connect.sh 80 3e41a200bd
sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_connect.sh 443 c9277c986d</pre>

	  The connection keys are provided to him by you. He should
	  make sure that he does not have any local webserver running
	  on ports 80 and 443. Now he can
	  open <strong>localhost</strong>
	  or <strong>127.0.0.1</strong> on his browser and he will
	  directly access your local webserver.
	</li>
	<li>To stop sharing, both of you can run:
	  <pre>sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_stop.sh 3e41a200bd
sudo p2p-vnc/client/port_stop.sh c9277c986d</pre>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The same way can be used for sharing other ports/services as
    well.</p>
